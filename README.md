##Agentic AI Travel Planner

**Intelligent Multi-City Travel Planning Using LangChain Agents + Real-Time APIs

##📌 Project Overview

This project implements an Agentic AI-based travel planning system that autonomously gathers, synthesizes, and analyzes real-time data to generate personalized travel recommendations.

Using LangChain’s agent framework, the system orchestrates multiple external APIs to provide:

 📍 **Location geocoding**
- 🌦 **Weather forecasting**
- 🌫 **Air quality monitoring (AQI)**
- 🗺 **Tourist attraction discovery**
- 👕 **Clothing recommendations**
- ☂ **Umbrella and face mask advisories**
  
The solution demonstrates how AI agents can coordinate tool-based workflows to produce structured, real-world decision support outputs.

##🎯 Business Problem

**Travelers planning multi-city trips often rely on fragmented sources for:

- Weather conditions  
- Environmental air quality  
- Attractions and points of interest  
- Packing and preparation decisions 

This project addresses that fragmentation by building an autonomous AI planning assistant that:

Collects information from multiple data providers

- Applies domain logic

- Produces a consolidated travel plan

- Reduces manual research effort

##🧠 Agent Architecture

The system follows a tool-driven agent architecture:

User Input (Cities)
        ↓
LangChain Agent (LLM Orchestrator)
        ↓
---------------------------------
| Geocoding API                 |
| Weather API (Google/OpenWeather) |
| Air Quality API               |
| Places API (Attractions)      |
---------------------------------
        ↓
Decision Logic Layer
(Clothing, Umbrella, Mask Rules)

Structured Travel Plan Output

| File               | Purpose                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `main.py`          | Entry point and multi-city execution logic      |
| `agent.py`         | LangChain agent creation and tool orchestration |
| `tools.py`         | API integrations and helper functions           |
| `config.py`        | Environment variable configuration              |
| `streamlit_app.py` | Web UI interface (optional)                     |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies                             |

##🚀 How To Run Locally
1️⃣ Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AgenticAI_Proj1.git
cd AgenticAI_Proj1

2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key


⚠️ .env is ignored from GitHub for security.

5️⃣ Run Agent From Terminal

Single or multi-city input:

python main.py Paris Tokyo Toronto


Or interactive mode:

python main.py

🌐 Streamlit Web Interface (Optional)

Launch web UI:

streamlit run streamlit_app.py


Then open:

http://localhost:8501

📊 Example Output

For each city the agent returns:

Coordinates & formatted address

3-day weather forecast

AQI value and health category

Top nearby attractions

Clothing advice

Umbrella recommendation

Mask advisory

##🔐 Security & Best Practices

✔ API keys stored using environment variables
✔ .env excluded from repository
✔ Modular architecture
✔ Tool fallback logic
✔ Error handling and graceful degradation
